     Not ready, I get it...
Don’t want complications:
You gotta focus on yourself.
You cancel, no worries;
It’s all good, no hurry...
Your heart belongs to someone else.
You know I’m always here
To keep you company, company
But I can’t help but feel
It’s not enough for me...
[Chorus:]
Maybe I don’t wanna be just friends
See you only on the weekends.
Sorry, hope you understand:
I like you a little too much for that!
Maybe I don’t wanna be just friends,
Always hearing 'bout your ex...
Sorry, there’s no going back:
I like you a little too much for that!
Maybe I don’t wanna be...
If I’m such a nice guy
And you had a great time,
Why don’t we kick it up a notch?
How about you come over,
Move into me closer
And let my hands give it a shot?
You know I’m always here
To keep you company, company
But I can’t help but feel
It’s not enough for me...
