     Not ready, I get it...
Don’t want complications:
You gotta focus on yourself.
You cancel, no worries;
It’s all good, no hurry...
Your heart belongs to someone else.
You know I’m always here
To keep you company, company
But I can’t help but feel
It’s not enough for me...
[Chorus:]
Maybe I don’t wanna be just friends
See you only on the weekends.
Sorry, hope you understand:
I like you a little too much for that!
Maybe I don’t wanna be just friends,
Always hearing 'bout your ex...
Sorry, there’s no going back:
I like you a little too much for that!
Maybe I don’t wanna be...
If I’m such a nice guy
And you had a great time,
Why don’t we kick it up a notch?
How about you come over,
Move into me closer
And let my hands give it a shot?
You know I’m always here
To keep you company, company
But I can’t help but feel
It’s not enough for me...

Missing you
Empty rooms
I still can’t believe it’s true
It’s the end for me and you
Feeling blue
Since i flew
A thousand miles away from you
Why couldn’t we make it through?
‘cause i still feel like
We had a chance
You drew the map and i made the plans
So when did this road unwind
I thought i saw the signs
I thought you’d be the one by my side
The one who’d put my name up in lights
The one i could paint in pictures all across the room
I thought you’d be my wish upon a star
The one who’d fall asleep inside my arms
The one who would have and hold and love me through and through
But i guess it’s not you
Fancy bars
Fancy cars
Driving down the boulevard
Empty seat inside my heart
Tried it all
Crystal ball
Looking glass right on my wall
Couldn’t tell me where you are
‘cause i still feel like
I’m missing the days
I was the ember to your blaze
So how did this trail derail
When we never crossed through hell
I thought you’d be the one by my side
The one who’d put my name up in lights
The one i could paint in pictures all across the room
I thought you’d be my wish upon a star
The one who’d fall asleep inside my arms
The one who would have and hold and love me through and through
But i guess it’s not you
I know that i shouldn’t but i keep missing you
Never thought that i’d have to let you go so soon
I thought you’d be the one by my side
The one who’d put my name up in lights
The one i could paint in pictures all across the room
I thought you’d be my wish upon a star
The one who’d fall asleep inside my arms
The one i would have and hold i’d love you through and through
But i guess it’s not you
But i guess it’s not you
But i guess it’s not you

Why couldn’t we make it through?
‘cause i still feel like
We had a chance
You drew the map and i made the plans
So when did this road unwind
I thought i saw the signs
I thought you’d be the one by my side
The one who’d put my name up in lights
The one i could paint in pictures all across the room
I thought you’d be my wish upon a star
The one who’d fall asleep inside my arms
The one who would have and hold and love me through and through
But i guess it’s not you
Fancy bars
Fancy cars
Driving down the boulevard
Empty seat inside my heart
Tried it all
Crystal ball
Looking glass right on my wall
Couldn’t tell me where you are
‘cause i still feel like
I’m missing the days
I was the ember to your blaze
So how did this trail derail
When we never crossed through hell
I thought you’d be the one by my side
The one who’d put my name up in lights
The one i could paint in pictures all across the room
I thought you’d be my wish upon a star
The one who’d fall asleep inside my arms
The one who would have and hold and love me through and through
But i guess it’s not you
I know that i shouldn’t but i keep missing you
Never thought that i’d have to let you go so soon
I thought you’d be the one by my side
The one who’d put my name up in lights
The one i could paint in pictures all across the room
I thought you’d be my wish upon a star
The one who’d fall asleep inside my arms
The one i would have and hold i’d love you through and through
But i guess it’s not you
But i guess it’s not you
But i guess it’s not youMissing you
Empty rooms
I still can’t believe it’s true
It’s the end for me and you
Feeling blue
Since i flew
A thousand miles away from you
Why couldn’t we make it through?

The one who’d put my name up in lights
The one i could paint in pictures all across the room
I thought you’d be my wish upon a star
The one who’d fall asleep inside my arms
The one who would have and hold and love me through and through

But i guess it’s not you

Fancy bars
Fancy cars
Driving down the boulevard
Empty seat inside my heart

Tried it all
Crystal ball
Looking glass right on my wall
Couldn’t tell me where you are

‘cause i still feel like
I’m missing the days
I was the ember to your blaze
So how did this trail derail
When we never crossed through hell

I thought you’d be the one by my side
The one who’d put my name up in lights
The one i could paint in pictures all across the room
I thought you’d be my wish upon a star
The one who’d fall asleep inside my arms
The one who would have and hold and love me through and through

But i guess it’s not you

I know that i shouldn’t but i keep missing you
Never thought that i’d have to let you go so soon

I thought you’d be the one by my side

But i guess it’s not you

But i guess it’s not you
But i guess it’s not you
Missing you
Empty rooms
I still can’t believe it’s true
It’s the end for me and you

Feeling blue
Since i flew
A thousand miles away from you
Why couldn’t we make it through?

‘cause i still feel like
We had a chance
You drew the map and i made the plans
So when did this road unwind
I thought i saw the signs

I thought you’d be the one by my side
The one who’d put my name up in lights
